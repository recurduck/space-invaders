Step1 – Setup the board 
1.	Create a 14x14 matrix containing strings (later on you can switch to a more advanced model of cells as described in code above). Place 1 line of aliens on top, no need for them to move just yet
15 min 

2. createHero 
5 min

3. render board
12 min

Step2 – Move the hero. 
8 min

Step3 – Shoot Aliens. 
30 min (there is a pitfall with the setInterval and positions)

Step4 – Let the aliens move 16:43
Note – when aliens are moving, debug becomes harder, implement a freeze feature early so you can stop them for debug
17:26 still trying to figure it out how to do it
it wasn't clear if I need to move all the alians togather or each row seperatly because the game example
18:18 took a break
21:30 returned to work on features 
22:37 finished to fix shooting - aliens rows move - game over situations
total: 1:45h

restart/start feature - 10min

Super mode - Hitting the “X” Key will give you no limit on laser shots you fire for 3 seconds. You have 3 Super Attacks.
10 min but had issues with create new lasers will take care later

Blow up neighbors - when player press 'n' – if the laser has neighbors that are aliens – they are all cleared
8 min with small bug with the laser interval

had a big bug when i set gBoard[i][j] above the aliens it create for all over the column the string
after some thinking I understood that I copied pointers in the arrays so all the rows above aliens are equal pointers
            board[i + 1] = board[i] => just needed to add .slice() 
            after some runs there is still some bugs so I understood we should do a deep copy for the lines!

Shields:
Hitting the “Z” Key will guard you from the next laser for 5 seconds. You have 3 shields.
10 min (waiting for the rock feature)

Step1 – Setup the board 
1.	Create a 14x14 matrix containing strings (later on you can switch to a more advanced model of cells as described in code above). Place 1 line of aliens on top, no need for them to move just yet
15 min 
2. createHero 
5 min
3. render board 12 min
Step2 – Move the hero. 8 min
Step3 – Shoot Aliens. 30 min
Step4 – Let the aliens move 16:43
Note – when aliens are moving, debug becomes harder, implement a freeze feature early so you can stop them for debug
17:26 still trying to figure it out how to do it
it wasn't clear if I need to move all the alians togather or each row seperatly
18:18 took a break
